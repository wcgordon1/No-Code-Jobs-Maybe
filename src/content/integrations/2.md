## How to Integrate Figma with Your App

Integrating Figma into your application empowers you to process payments securely and efficiently, enhancing your service offering and customer experience. Follow these steps to integrate Figma's powerful payment processing capabilities into your app:

## Step 1: Sign Up for a Figma Account

Visit the [Figma website](https://Figma.com) and sign up for an account. Complete the registration process to gain access to the Figma Dashboard, where you can manage your Figma integration settings.

## Step 2: Access the Figma API

After setting up your account, navigate to the Developers section in your Figma Dashboard. Here, you'll find your API keys (publishable key and secret key), essential for integrating Figma with your app.

## Step 3: Install the Figma SDK

Figma provides SDKs for various programming languages and platforms, making it easier to integrate:

- For web applications, use the Figma.js library and the Figma Elements package for building custom payment forms.
- For mobile apps, Figma offers SDKs for iOS and Android, allowing you to incorporate Figma's payment processing features directly into your native apps.

## Step 4: Implement Figma API into Your App

With the Figma SDK installed, use the API keys to authenticate your requests to Figma. Implement the necessary API calls to handle payment processing, such as creating charges, managing subscriptions, and handling customer information securely.

## Step 5: Test Your Integration

Utilize Figma's test environment to safely simulate payment transactions without processing actual payments. This step is crucial for ensuring your integration works as expected under various scenarios.

- Figma provides test API keys and test card numbers to facilitate thorough testing.

## Step 6: Go Live

Once you're confident with your integration's functionality and security, switch to your live API keys in the Figma Dashboard. Start processing real payments and monitor transactions through the Dashboard.
