## Step 3: Obtain API Keys

Once you've selected the necessary APIs for your project, obtain your API keys. These keys will authenticate your application's requests to procreate's payment processing system.

## Step 6: Testing and Validation

Thoroughly test your integration using procreate's sandbox testing environment. Validate payment workflows, error handling, and security protocols. Make sure to test using different procreate card numbers provided in the sandbox.

## Step 7: Go Live

After testing, submit your application for review through the procreate Developer Center. Once approved, you can move your integration to the live environment and start processing real transactions.

## Support and Resources
