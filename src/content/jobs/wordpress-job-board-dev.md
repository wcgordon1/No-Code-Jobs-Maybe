### Warm Websites Job Board Scope

- Envato Elements Kit (optional, thought this would make things easier)
- Elementor Pro
- WP-Job-Manager (Bundle)
- Tiny Giant Elementor connector
- WooCommerce

Building a job board for electricians. This is a demo test project to see if you have the skills. 

Intervew Project: **Flat rate: $500 for the entire build.**

**Hourly rate: $15 - $20 /hourly.**

I will provide all plugins and access.

All I'd like to see is a list of job boards you have built on WordPress with a similar tech stack.

You can email [chris@warmwebsites.com](mailto:chris@warmwebsites.com) with the sites and anything else you think is important. Also, email your hourly rate. We've found test projects are a great way to test working with devs before we bring on talent.

We will most likely pick 3 people to test and hire 2 full-time.

- **SEO Optimization:** Implement on-page SEO best practices to improve search engine rankings for job postings and related content, including schema markup, metadata, and keyword targeting.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Conduct thorough testing and debugging of the site to ensure optimal performance, security, and functionality across different browsers and devices.
- **Documentation and Training:** Create documentation for custom features and provide training to our team on how to manage and operate the job board effectively.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Monitor performance, gather user feedback, and implement continuous improvements to enhance the site’s functionality, speed, and user engagement.
